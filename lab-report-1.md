# **Lab Report 1**
## How To Get Remote Access
---
> **Download VScode and Git If You Need It**
- VScode must be dowloaded. I already had VScode downloaded prior to the lab so I could skip this step but if I need to in the future I can download it from [this link]([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Git for Windows must be downloaded if you use a windows computer which you get with [this link](https://gitforwindows.org/)

> **Remotely Connecting**
- Open a terminal in VScode
- Go to the lower righthand corner and click the "v" symple next to the "+" symbol which should give you a list of options to select, and you need to select Git Bash
- Now in the terminal type ssh courseAccountName@ieng6.ucsd.edu and enter, with "courseAccountName" replaced by your actual course account name (note that in the photos since this was not working in lab I used my school not course username)
- If prompted with a message of if you want to continue type yes and enter, this can happen if you are on a new server for the first time, then give you password and enter
- Now you are connected!
